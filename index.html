    <h1>My trip to Padelford</h1>

    <p>
      I got lost trying to go to a TA's office hours in Padelford, an old and
      confusing building on UW's campus.
    </p>

    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>
      Padelford was built in the 1960's with an intentionally jarring layout
      so that protestors could not easily congregate within the building. The
      unpleasent design of Padelford continues to annoy students looking for
      TA's to this day.

      <p>This is the floor plan of Padelford. Gross.</p>

    <h3>My experience</h3>
    <p>
      I walked into Padelford through the front entrance. I went left to find
      the elevator. Once in the elevator, I went to the third floor. Once on
      the third floor, I walked around for 10 minutes before realizing I had
      no clue where my Ta's office was. After begging a random professor for
      help, I finally found the office at the back end corner of the building.
