      <h1>My trip to Padelford</h1>

      <p>
        I got lost trying to go to a TA's office hours in
        Padelford, an old and confusing building on UW's campus.
      </p>

      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>
        Padelford was built in the 1960's with an intentionally jarring layout
        so that protestors could not easily congregate within the building. The
        unpleasent design of Padelford continues to annoy students looking for TA's to this day.
      </p>

      <div>
        <img src="./images/padelford.png" alt="Floor layout of Padelford" />
        <p>This is the floor plan of Padelford. Gross.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>My experience</h3>
      <p>I walked into Padelford through the front entrance. I went left to find the elevator. Once in the elevator, I went to the third floor. Once on the third floor, I walked around for 10 minutes before realizing I had no clue where my Ta's office was. After begging a random professor for help, I finally found the office at the back end corner of the building.</p>
